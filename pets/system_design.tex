\section{\system{}: Routing Around Nation-States}
\label{system_design}

%The previous section showed a first step at demonstrating the extent of the 
%large-scale surveillance problem, and to our knowledge, there are no existing low-cost, 
%effective countermeasures to this problem.  As we have seen an increase in the number of 
%Internet users electing to use anonymity and circumvention systems, such as Tor, we 
%believe that there are Internet users that would also benefit from a system that 
%counters large-scale surveillance.  

From our experience conducting measurement studies of Internet paths, we have identified 
a number of obstacles standing in the way of building such systems.  These primarily include a lack 
of possible measurement methods to learn reverse paths---these are crucial because paths 
are asymmetric even at the country level---and a lack of knowledge about the locations in which 
content is replicated.  

We can surmount many of these obstacles if content providers contributed to the surveillance 
avoidance system.  To address the issue of path asymmetry, the reverse path could be measured from within the provider and used to determine if 
an unfavorable country is on the reverse path; this could be used in conjunction with our measurements 
of the forward path.  In addition, content providers could strategically publish DNS records such that when a client receives 
a DNS response, it is for a content replica that allows her to avoid a given country.  A content provider could also 
replicate content in specific regions to allow clients to access replicas without traversing a specific 
country. 

We take an approach at designing 
a system that is a first to route traffic around a given country {\it without} the help 
of providers.  Because the design does not assume any cooperation from content providers, 
the system does not (and cannot) always ensure that some Internet path avoids a 
particular country. 

\subsection{Threat Model}

\system{} addresses an adversary who is restricted to a specific region of the world.  The 
adversary can be passive, and conduct surveillance, or active, and interfere with traffic. We 
realize that a country's surveillance capabilities are not limited to the infrastructure within 
its borders, but a country typically can only interfere and manipulate traffic within its borders. 
For the purposes of this system, we assume the adversary can only view and manipulate traffic 
within its borders.

An adversary who taps routers around the world, splices undersea fiber cables, or participates in 
surveillance in foreign states is out of the scope of this work; while \system{} does not address this 
type of attacker, \system{} does protect against an attacker whose interference and monitoring 
capabilities are limited to a specific land mass.

\subsection{Overview}
\system{} comprises (1)~an overlay network of relays; and (2)~an oracle that
directs clients to the appropriate relays, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:arch}.
\system{}'s relays are TCP proxy servers that allow clients to access web
content without installing custom software. \system{} uses the measurement
methods described in Section~\ref{avoid_results} to learn paths between
clients, relays, and domains; these results are stored at the oracle, which
uses the data to decide which relay a client in some location should use for
accessing a certain domain while avoiding a certain country.  The oracle
periodically computes paths for many combinations of client AS, destination,
and country.   A client can then query the oracle to determine the appropriate
relay to use to avoid a certain country en route to a particular destination.

After describing our threat model and enumerating our design goals for \system{}, we explain each component of
the system in more detail. 

%Once the TCP proxies are established, a client needs
%to learn which proxy to use when accessing a given domain.

%domains should be accessed through which relays (based on the measured paths).  
%4) The client configures her browser to use the oracle-generated PAC file.  5) 
%The client's traffic is routed through relays (or direct paths) to access domains, 
%while avoiding a client-specified country.}
%\label{fig:arch}
%\end{figure}

\subsection{Periodic Path Measurement}

\system{} measures all paths using {\tt 
traceroute}, which is then mapped to the country level using the same methods as 
described in Section~\ref{datasets} and shown in Figure~\ref{fig:analysis_pipeline}.
The paths we measure are the: forward paths from 
the client to each relay; forward paths from each relay to each domain; forward
paths from the client to each domain; and reverse paths from each relay to the 
client. 
%Figure \ref{fig:paths} shows the forward and reverse paths when accessing 
%content using relays; the only path we cannot measure is the reverse path from 
%the domains to the relays because we have no 
%vantage point at or near the domain for running traceroute.
The portion of the reverse path from the domains to the relays is
challenging to measure due to a lack of vantage points in ASes of common
destinations. As discussed in Section \ref{pipeline}, we found that  the
forward and reverse paths are asymmetric at the country level, and therefore
\system{} cannot make any guarantees about which countries are on the path
between  domains and relays even though it has calculated the paths from
relays to domains.   Despite the lack of knowledge about this part of the
reverse path,  we can reason about possible scenarios.  If the client's
traffic is encrypted, then a country on this part of
the reverse path that the client wishes to avoid cannot perform any  traffic correlation
attacks or website
fingerprinting attacks, as the country cannot see who the client is (necessary
for website fingerprinting) and does not have access to more than one part of
the path (necessary for traffic correlation attacks).

\subsubsection{Client-to-Relay Paths} 
To avoid requiring the client to install custom software, \system{}
measures client-to-relay paths from RIPE Atlas probes that serve as 
vantage points for the ASes where \system{} clients might be.  \system{} selects
probes that
are geographically close the client (\eg, in the same 
country). The oracle triggers the probe to run traceroutes
to each relay.  After collecting the responses, the oracle maps 
the IP-level paths to country-level paths and stores the results.

\subsubsection{Relay-to-Client Paths} The \system{} relays perform
traceroutes to the IP addresses of RIPE Atlas probes, which 
represent client ASes.  They then derive country-level paths; the
oracle learns these paths from each relay.  

\subsubsection{Relay-to-Server Paths} Relays perform 
traceroutes to each domain.  As with paths to clients,
relays derive country-level paths and send them to the oracle.

\subsubsection{Client-to-Server Paths} In case a path from a client to a 
domain does not pass through the country specified to avoid {\it by default}, 
then none of the proxies should be used.  
%If a proxy is used, then it may 
%actually be causing the path to traverse more countries
%(unnecessarily).  
These paths are measured using the RIPE Atlas probes in similar
locations as the clients, and the oracle triggers traceroutes from
each of them to each of the domains.  Corresponding country-level
paths are stored at the oracle.

\system{} must recompute these paths as they change.  To our knowledge, there has not been any previous work 
on how often country-level paths change; prior work has explored how often 
AS-level paths change.  We measured the country-level paths from a RIPE Atlas probe to the 
Alexa Top 100 domains once per day for a month to see how stable country-level paths 
are.  Across the measured domains, we found the average time between path changes to 
be about five days.  Therefore, \system{} re-computes the paths every five days to incorporate the 
most recent country-level paths.  

%To measure how often country-level paths change, we 
%computed the paths from relays to domains once every two hours and once every 
%hour.  Fewer than five paths changed every two hours; the 
%results were similar for one-hour increments.  As it takes approximately 30 minutes to 
%compute all paths, \system{} re-computes the paths every one hour to incorporate 
%the most recent country-level paths.

%path from domain to relay; 4) reverse path from relay to client.  \system{} measures 
%all paths except for path 3) due to a lack of vantage points at domain locations.}

\subsection{PAC File Generation}
\label{multiplex}
The oracle follows four steps to decide which relay a client should
use to access a specific domain: (1)~If the default path from the
client to the domain does not pass through the specified country, then
do not use any of the relays.  (2)~Otherwise, for all the paths from
the client to the relays, select suitable relays, which are relays where the country 
to avoid is not on the forward or reverse path between the client and 
relay.  (3)~From this set, if there
is a path from a suitable relay to the domain that does not include
the specified country, then use that relay for that domain.  (4)~If
there is no path from the client through any of the relays to the
domain that does not pass through the specified country, then select
the relay that provides the most avoidance (measured by how many other
domains that avoid the specified country).
\begin{figure}[t]
\renewcommand{\lstlistingname}{Configuration}
\lstinputlisting[label={lst:pac}, language=JavaScript, frame=single,
basicstyle=\footnotesize, caption={Example PAC file.}]{example_pac.pac}
\vspace*{-0.25in}
\end{figure}
The oracle applies this decision process to each domain, which results
in a mapping of domains to relays that can be used to avoid the given
country.  To facilitate automatic multiplexing between relays,
\system{} utilizes Proxy Autoconfiguration (PAC) files, which define
how browsers should choose a proxy when fetching a URL.  In the
example PAC file in Configuration~\ref{lst:pac}, proxy 1.2.3.4:3128
should be used when accessing {\tt www.google.com}, but proxy
5.6.7.8:3128 should be used when accessing {\tt www.twitter.com}.  The
oracle uses the mapping of domains to relays to generate a PAC file,
which specifies which domains should be accessed through which proxy.
The PAC file is published online to a URL of the format
$<$client\_country$>$\_$<$country\_to\_avoid$>$\_pac.pac.  The client
uses this URL to specify their proxy configuration.  Paths are
re-computed every five days, so the contents of the PAC file are also
updated every five days.
% The PAC files are published online, which allows a client to simply
% point the proxy configuration settings to the URL that contains the
% PAC file.

\subsection{Extending \system{} with Content Provider Support}

While the current version of \system{} does not include support by content providers, it can be easily, incrementally,
extended to do so without any fundamental changes to the system.  This would simply require providers (or a 
CDN) to collect and share traceroute data from their server locations to different client and proxy locations; \system{} 
would then convert the traceroute data to country level paths and incorporate them into the calculation of the 
PAC files.  For content hosted in public clouds, we could set up our own VM in those same data centers and have 
\system{} collect the reverse path traceroute data to use when creating the PAC files.  

Content provider participation beyond gathering traceroute data would be even more beneficial and would lead to 
more extensive changes to \system{}.  Some of the help that content providers and CDNs could provide include 
publishing domain names that embed information about which country to avoid, strategically publish DNS records such 
that clients can take advantage of open DNS resolvers, and replicating content in diverse geographic locations.
