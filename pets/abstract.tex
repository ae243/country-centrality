\begin{abstract}{Many countries now engage in interference, degradation, blocking, or
surveillance of Internet traffic.  In response, individuals, organizations, and even 
entire countries are taking steps to control the geographic regions that their traffic 
traverses. For example, some countries are building local Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) 
to prevent domestic traffic from detouring through other countries. Unfortunately, our 
measurements reveal that many such ongoing efforts are futile, for two reasons: local content 
is often hosted in foreign countries, and networks within a country often fail to peer with one 
another. Yet, our work offers hope: we also find that routing traffic through strategically 
placed relay nodes can reduce transnational routing detours, in the best case, from 85\% of studied 
paths traversing a given country to 38\%.  Based on these findings, we design and implement 
\system{}, a lightweight system that routes a client's web traffic around specified countries 
with no modifications to client software (and in many cases with little performance overhead). 
Anyone can use \system{} today; we have deployed long-running \system{} relays around the world, 
released the source code, and provided instructions for clients to use the system.}
