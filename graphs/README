This folder contains code to generate graphs (as well as the resulting graphs)

x_host.png:
    A pie chart that shows which countries host domains that clients in x often access

x_trombone.txt:
    Lists which countries x's traffic trombones to

x_results.txt:

domain_histogram.py:
    Generates a histogram of the number of subsequent requests per original domain request

make_pie.py:
    Generates x_host.png and x_transit.png (but requires manual changes for different countries and to generate host vs transit chart)

trombone_graph.py:
    Generates bar chart of which countries traffic trombones to (requires manual changes for different countries)
