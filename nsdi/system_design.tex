\section{Design}
\label{system_design}

We now present the design of \system{}.

\subsection{Architecture}

Figure~\ref{fig:arch} shows the \system{} architecture, which includes
an overlay network of relays and an oracle that directs the client
traffic to the appropriate relays depending on which country the client
wishes to avoid.
\system{}  uses 
the measurement methods described earlier to learn the paths between clients, 
relays, and domains, and they are stored at the oracle.  The oracle uses the 
measured paths to decide which relay a client in some location should
use for accessing a certain domain while avoiding a certain country.
The oracle periodically computes paths for many combinations of client AS,
destination, and country.
A client can then query the oracle to determine the appropriate relay to
use for avoiding a certain country en route to a particular destination.

\system{}'s relays are TCP proxy servers, which allow clients to access
web content without installing software.  In contrast, IP layer proxies
require the client to install software, which violates our
usability goal. Once the TCP proxies are established, a
client needs to learn which proxy to use when accessing a given
domain.  The next section explains the challenges associated with path
measurement and how we tackle them.

\subsection{Periodic Path Measurement}

All of the paths are measured using {\tt 
traceroute}, which is then mapped to the country level using the same methods as 
described in Section \ref{datasets} and shown in Figure 
\ref{fig:analysis_pipeline}.  The paths we measure are the: forward paths from 
the client to each relay, forward paths from each relay to each domain, forward 
paths from the client to each domain, and reverse paths from each relay to the 
client. Figure \ref{fig:paths} shows the forward and reverse paths when accessing 
content using relays; the only path we cannot measure is the reverse path from 
the domains to the relays because we have no 
vantage point at or near the domain from which to run traceroute.

\paragraph{Client-to-Relay Paths.} 
To avoid requiring the client to install custom software, \system{}
measures client-to-relay paths from RIPE Atlas probes that serve as 
vantage points for potential client ASes.  \system{} selects probes that
are geographically close the client (\eg, in the same 
country). The oracle triggers the probe to run traceroutes
to each relay in the system.  After collecting the responses, the oracle maps 
the IP-level paths to country-level paths and stores the results.

\paragraph{Relay-to-Client Paths.} The relays perform
traceroutes to the IP addresses of RIPE Atlas probes, which 
represent client ASes.  They then derives country-level paths; the
oracle learns these paths from each relay.  

\paragraph{Relay-to-Server Paths.} Relays perform 
traceroutes to each domain.  As with paths to clients,
relays derive country-level paths and sends them to the oracle.

\paragraph{Client to Server Paths.} In the case that a path from a client to a 
domain does not pass through the country specified to avoid {\it by default}, 
then none of the proxies should be used.  If a proxy is used, then it may 
actually be causing the path to traverse more countries (unnecessarily).  These 
paths are measured using the RIPE Atlas probes in similar locations as the 
clients, and the oracle triggers traceroutes from each of
them to each of the domains.  Corresponding country-level paths 
are stored at the oracle.  

These paths must be re-computed 
as paths may change.  To our knowledge, there has not been any previous work 
on how often country-level paths change; prior work has explored how often 
AS-level paths change.  To measure how often country-level paths change, we 
computed the paths from relays to domains once every two hours and once every 
hour.  Fewer than five paths changed every two hours; the 
results were similar for one-hour increments.  As it takes approximately 30 minutes to 
compute all paths, \system{} re-computes the paths every one hour to incorporate 
the most recent country-level paths.

%1) forward path from client to relay; 2) forward path from relay to domain; 3) reverse 
%path from domain to relay; 4) reverse path from relay to client.  \system{} measures 
%all paths except for path 3) due to a lack of vantage points at domain locations.}
%\label{fig:path_components}
%\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:paths}, shows the four components of paths between a
client and correspoding web content.  The system measures three 
out of the four paths; the reverse path from the domains (servers) to the relays 
is challenging to measure due to a lack of vantage points in ASes of
common destinations.  Despite the inability to measure this part of the
path, it would be difficult for the country being avoided to perform
traffic analysis because it is{\it at most} only on the reverse path 
from the server to the relay. 

\subsection{PAC File Generation}
\label{multiplex}
After measuring and aggregating the country-level paths, the oracle decides 
which relay to use when accessing specific domains from a specific client 
location.  This decision follows four steps:
(1)~If the default path from the client to the domain does not pass through 
the specified country, then do not use any of the relays. 
(2)~Otherwise, for all the paths from the client to the relays, select usable relays 
such that the path does not contain the specified country.
(3)~From this set, if there is a path from a 
usable relay to the domain that does not include the specified country, then 
use that relay for that domain.
(4)~If there is no path from the client through any of the relays to the domain 
that does not pass through the specified country, then select the relay 
that provides the most avoidance (measured by how many other domains
that avoid the specified country). 

The oracle applies this decision process to each domain, which results in a mapping 
of domains to relays that can be used to avoid the given country.  To facilitate 
automatic multiplexing between relays, \system{} utilizes Proxy Autoconfiguration (PAC) 
files.  A PAC file defines how browsers should choose a proxy when fetching a URL.  A 
sample PAC file is shown in Listing \ref{lst:pac}; in this example, proxy 
1.2.3.4:3128 should be used when accessing {\tt www.google.com}, but proxy 
5.6.7.8:3128 should be used when accessing {\tt www.twitter.com}.  The oracle uses 
the mapping of domains to relays to generate a PAC 
file, which specifies which domains should be accessed through which proxy.  Once the PAC 
file is generated based on the decision chain above, it is published to a URL 
of the format $<$client\_country$>$\_$<$country\_to\_avoid$>$\_pac.pac.  The client 
uses this URL to specify their proxy configuration.  Paths are re-computed 
every hour, so the PAC file is also re-computed and published every hour.  The PAC files 
are published online, which allows a client to simply point the proxy
configuration settings to the URL that contains the PAC file.

\subsection{Scalability and Fault Tolerance}
Adding relays to \system{} is 
straightforward. Additionally, \system{} is resilient to failures of system components.

\paragraph{Adding relays and oracles.} To add a relay, the system
operator must set up a machine as a proxy server, install the \system{}
relay software, and update the oracle's list of relays.  From that point
forward, paths will be computed to and from the new relay, and clients
will be using it as a proxy.  Adding an oracle requires installing the
oracle software on a different machine, and specifying the client
locations handled by that oracle (for example, one oracle handles all
clients in North America and Europe, and another oracle handles all clients
elsewhere).  Both oracles will publish the PAC files to the same server,
which causes no changes for the client.

\paragraph{Failed relays and oracles.} If a relay becomes unresponsive,
this issue is handled by the PAC file.  The PAC file allows the oracle
to specify multiple proxies in a sequential order, such that if the the
first proxy fails, then the second proxy is used (and so on).  This
feature can be used to specify all of the relays that have a path to the
domain.  And future work can include relay replicas that can be used in
the case that a relay crashes.  Among other mechanisms, we can detect a
failed oracle by determining that its PAC file is older than one hour.
Detecting a failed oracle could trigger a backup oracle to re-compute
the PAC files periodically.  Because oracles are stateless, failover is
straightforward.  Without backup oracles, clients can still use the
system when the oracle fails.  The clients will simply be using stale
paths, which are likely (but not guaranteed) to be functional, since
country-level paths change infrequently.
