\section{Design Goals}

Here we highlight the main goals of \system{}, as well as challenges that are out 
of the scope of this work.

{\bf Foreign Country Avoidance.}  The primary goal of \system{} is to avoid a given
 country when accessing web content.  \system{} should provide clients a way to 
route around a specified country, while still being able to access the desired 
domain.

{\bf Usability.} \system{} should be designed in a way that is accessible to and 
easy to use by clients around the world.  It should require as little effort by 
the client as possible.

{\bf Scalability.}  This country avoidance system should be able to scale to 
large numbers of users.  Therefore, \system{} should be able to handle the addition
 of relays, as well as be cost-effective in terms of resources required.

{\bf Non-goals.}  There are some challenges that \system{} does not attempt to 
solve.  The system does not address the notion of anonymity; it routes around 
countries (for reasons such as avoiding mass surveillance), but it does not 
attempt to keep users anonymous.  

Additionally, \system{} does not solve the problem of domestic surveillance (for 
example, a client in the United States attempting to avoid surveillance by the 
United States).  This is a challenging problem, and asks for future research, 
but this is out of the scope of our work.
