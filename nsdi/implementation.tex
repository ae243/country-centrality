\section{\system{}: Implementation}
Our prototype implementation of \system{} is based on a series of relays, an oracle, and 
a client. All \system{} software can be found at ... \annie{I'll add in wherever we end 
putting it anonymously}

{\bf Relays.}  We established three relays; one in Brazil, one in Germany, and 
one in Singapore.  They are running as Ubuntu Virtual Private Servers (VPSs) with 
Squid as the proxy server.  It is also running the \system{} Relay software.

{\bf Oracle.}  The oracle is a Fujitsu RX200 S8 server with dual, 
eight-core 2.8GHz Intel Xeon E5 2680 v2 processors with 256GB RAM running the 
Springdale distribution of Linux. It is running the \system{} Oracle software.

{\bf Client.} For the purposes of the system evaluation, we set up a client 
machine in the Netherlands, which simply accesses web content and uses the PAC 
file.
