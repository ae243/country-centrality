\section{System Suitability}

\annie{discuss why this system might not be suitable for every country - with evidence of countries that aren't very connected}

\[Suitability(x,y) = (\frac{r_{~y~ \notin ~p_{x,r}}}{r_{\notin ~ y}})(\frac{p_{r_{~\notin ~y}, ~d, ~y ~\notin ~p}}{p_{~r_{~\notin ~y},~d}})\]

where $x$ is the client's country, $y$ is the country to be avoided, $r_{~y~ \notin ~p_{x,r}}$ is the number of relays such that the path from client in $x$ to relay $r$ does not include $y$, $r_{\notin ~ y}$ is the total number of relays not in $y$, $p_{r_{~\notin ~y}, ~d, ~y ~\notin ~p}$ is the number of suitable paths from any relay $r_{~y~ \notin ~p_{x,r}}$ to the Alexa Top 100 domains, and $p_{~r_{~\notin ~y},~d}$ is the total number of paths from relays $r_{~y~ \notin ~p_{x,r}}$ to the Alexa Top 100 domains.
