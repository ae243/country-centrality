\paragraph{Nation-State Routing Analysis.}  Recently, Shah and Papadopoulos measured international BGP detours (paths that originate in one country, cross international borders, and then return to the original country)~\cite{shah2015characterizing}.  Using BGP routing tables, they found 2 million detours in each month of their study (out of 7 billion total paths), and they then characterized the detours based on detour dynamics and persistence.  Our work differs by actively measuring traceroutes (actual paths), as opposed to analyzing BGP routes.  This difference is fundamental as BGP provides the AS path announced in BGP update messages, which is not necessarily the same as the actual path of data packets.  Obar and Clement analyzed traceroutes that started and ended in Canada, but ``boomeranged'' through the United States (``boomerang'' is another term for tromboning), and argued that this is a violation of Canadian network sovereignty~\cite{obar2012internet}.  Most closely related to our work, Karlin, Forest, and Rexford developed a framework for country-level routing analysis to study how much influence each country has over interdomain routing~\cite{karlin2009nation}.  This work measures the centrality of a country to routing and uses AS-path inference to measure and quantify country centrality, whereas our work uses active measurements and measures avoidability of a given country.

\paragraph{Mapping Local Internet.}  In 2011, Roberts et al. described
a method for mapping national networks of ASes, identifying ASes that
act as points of control in the national network, and measuring the
complexity of the national network~\cite{roberts2011mapping}.  There
have also been a number of studies that measured and classified the
network within a country.  Wahlisch et al. measured and classified the
ASes on the German Internet~\cite{wahlisch2010framework,
  wahlisch2012exposing}, Zhou et al. measured the complete
Chinese Internet topology at the AS level~\cite{zhou2007chinese}, and
Bischof et al. characterized the current state of Cuba's
connectivity with the rest of the world~\cite{bischof2015and}.
Interconnectivity has also been studied at the continent level; Gupta
et al. first looked at ISP interconnectivity within
Africa~\cite{gupta2014peering}, and it was studied later by Fanou,
Francois, and Aben~\cite{fanou2015diversity}. 


\paragraph{Circumvention Systems.}  There has been research into circumvention systems, particularly for censorship circumvention, that is related this work, but not sufficient for surveillance circumvention.  Tor is an anonymity system that uses 3 relays and layered encryption that allows users to communication anonymously~\cite{dingledine2004tor}.  Anonymity has different requirements than surveillance circumvention; for anonymity, it does not matter which country the traffic is routed through, but it does for surveillance.  Another existing system is VPNGate, which is a public VPN relay system aimed at circumventing national firewalls~\cite{nobori2014vpn}.  Unfortunately, VPNGate does not allow a client to choose any VPN available, which makes surveillance avoidance harder.
