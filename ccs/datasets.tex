\section{Measurement Infrastructure}
\label{datasets}
For this study, we made careful choices about the measurement infrastructure.  These included which vantage points within a country to use, which servers to use as relays, and which method to use for geolocating IP addresses.

\subsection{Vantage Points}
To our knowledge, the publicly available traceroute datasets suitable for our goal are from iPlane~\cite{madhyastha2006iplane} and CAIDA (Center for Applied Internet Data Analysis)~\cite{caida}.  The iPlane project uses PlanetLab ~\cite{planetlab} nodes to run traceroutes to a random set of IP addresses that cover all BGP atoms.  This project also has historical data as far back as 2006.  Unfortunately, because iPlane uses PlanetLab nodes, which have been shown to mostly use the Global Research and Education Network (GREN), the traceroutes run from PlanetLab nodes will not be representative of typical Internet users' traffic paths~\cite{banerjee2004interdomain}.  The other publicly available dataset, from CAIDA, ran traceroutes from different vantage points around the world, but to randomized destination IP addresses that cover all /24s.  This is also not sufficient for what we wanted to measure because a typical Internet user is going to access a domain that will be locally resolved; the user will not input a specific IP address in their browser.  Therefore, we chose to run active measurements that would be most representative of an Internet user.  We chose to run DNS and traceroute measurements from RIPE Atlas probes, which are hosted all around the world and in many different settings, include home networks~\cite{ripe_atlas}.  The first advantage of using RIPE Atlas is that the probes can use the local DNS resolver, which would give us the best estimate of the traceroute destination.  The next advantage is that we can control the parameters of traceroute; we specified to use paris traceroute as well as conducting both ICMP and TCP traceroutes.  We discuss more of our parameter selection and methodology in Section~\ref{measure}.

Our study looks at the Alexa Top 100 domains in different countries, as well as the 3rd party domains that are requested as part of an original web request.  To obtain these 3rd party domains we {\tt curl} each of the Top 100 domains, but we must do so from within the country we are studying.  There is no current functionality to {\tt curl} from RIPE Atlas probes, so we established a VPN connection within each of these countries to {\tt curl} each domain and extract the 3rd party domains.

\subsection{Servers}
As one of our research goals is to quantify how well the use of an overlay network will help clients avoid surveillance, we need access to a set of relays.  We used eight Amazon EC2 instances, one in each geographic region (United States, Ireland, Germany, Singapore, South Korea, Japan, Australia, Brazil), as well as 4 VPS machines (France, Spain, Brazil, Singapore).  The conjunction of these two sets of machines allow us to evaluate surveillance avoidance with a geographically diverse set of relays.

\subsection{Geolocation Data}
Previous work has shown that there are fundamental challenges in deducing a geographic location from an IP address, despite using different methods such as DNS names of the target, network delay measurements, and host-to-location mapping in conjunction with BGP prefix information~\cite{padmanabhan2001investigation}.  Because the focus of this work is on measuring and avoiding surveillance, and not on geolocation algorithms, we used a pre-existing geolocation service.  According to the literature, Digital Envoy provides the most accuracy when geolocating routers, so we use that service in our measurements and the design of our system~\cite{huffaker2011geocompare}. \annie{edit this if we end up just using MaxMind.}
