In this work, we have measured Internet paths to characterize routing
detours that take Internet paths through countries that perform
surveillance.  Our findings show that paths commonly traverse known
surveillance states, even when they originate and end in a
non-surveillance state.  As a possible step towards a remedy, we have
investigated how clients can use the open DNS resolver infrastructure
and overlay network relays to prevent routing detours through
unfavorable jurisdictions.  These methods give clients the power to
avoid certain countries, as well as help keep local traffic local.
Although some countries are completely avoidable, we find that some of
the more prominent surveillance states are the least avoidable.
