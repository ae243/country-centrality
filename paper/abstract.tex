\begin{abstract}
  We present \system{}, a system that allows Internet users to discover
  end-to-end Internet paths that avoid countries of their choosing. We
  conduct a large-scale measurement study to demonstrate that Internet
  paths often ``trombone'' to third-party countries, often to countries
  where laws may make users more vulnerable to surveillance than they
  would be in their home country. We then present the design and
  implementation of \system{}, an overlay network that allows users to
  quickly discover efficient end-to-end paths that avoid certain
  countries. \name{} operates with minimal modifications to client configuration and
  software and scales to a large number of users and web services.
