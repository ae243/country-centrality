\subsection{Country Avoidability}
General characterizations of the ability to achieve avoidance at all. Specifically, what (client,server,country) pairs are avoidable, for some interesting set of clients, servers, and countries? Which ones are not avoidable, and why?  (There may be interesting subcases here, by the way, about webpages for which parts of the page can achieve avoidance but others cannot.  Similarly, how many relays are necessary for one initial request (points out complexity)?)

\subsection{Performance}
Performance costs of each approach to the client. When a client uses any one of these services, how quickly can they retrieve a webpage?
\\
Costs of maintaining the (client,server)-relay mapping in each of the above approaches. (For various definitions of ``cost'' how many probes, how long does it take to maintain the mapping, etc.)
