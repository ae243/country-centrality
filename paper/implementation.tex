\section{Implementation}
\label{implementation}

Discuss what each component needs, what tools we used, and why.  Justify TinyProxy (usability), AWS.

Discuss how the client caches domain->relay mappings in config.  Once a day we pull from oracle and update whole config file.

Discuss how we map traceroutes to country-level paths in the oracle and the server.

Include paragraph on implementation improvements (DNS Server instead of oracle, scalability, load-balancing, performance optimizations (when no relay is needed), granularity, etc.)
