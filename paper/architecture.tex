\section{System Architecture}

\subsection{Design Goals}

Discuss threat model: a country or (colluding) countries (cite the different agreements that allow countries to share surveillance) that conduct surveillance - include diagrams of possible attacks.  Our system will work with multiple countries, but for simplicity, we give examples and evaluations with only one country to avoid.

Assumptions: Assume relays, clients, servers are not malicious.  Assume that no other attacks are occuring (MITM, hijack, etc.)  

Goals: firstly, country avoidance.  Usability (as few barriers to the client as possible).  We envision the system growing, and our goals for that would also be scalability, load-balancing, performance, etc.

\subsection{Architecture Overview}

Quick explanation of how all the pieces fit together and include a diagram.  Also discuss asymmetry study to justify why we care about the reverse path (and therefore server participation).

\subsubsection{Client} Describe what actions the client takes.

\subsubsection{Oracle} Describe what actions the oracle takes.

\subsubsection{Relay} Describe what actions the relays take.

\subsubsection{Server} Describe what actions the server takes.
