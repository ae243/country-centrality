The traceroutes we used from the iPlane project can be found in the /data/users/aedmundson/county-centrality directory of the dp7 machine.  The filename is in the format traces_<year>_<month>_<day>.txt and currently has traceroutes from the first week of September 2015.

This file will be updated as more data is processed.
