\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

We have characterized routing
detours through foreign countries, showing 
that underserved regions often depend on the U.S./Europe to 
access popular content; this can cause performance degradation, increased costs, 
and gives more power to dominant countries to perform surveillance and censorship.   %we have
%investigated how clients, ISPs, and governments can use overlay network relays to prevent routing detours through
%a given country.  This method gives clients the power to
%avoid certain countries, as well as help keep local traffic local.
%Although some countries are completely avoidable, we find that some of
%the more prominent surveillance states are the least avoidable.
As a first step towards a remedy, we have
designed, implemented, and deployed \system{}, which employs overlay network
relays to route traffic around a given country. %; our data and code is publicly available~\cite{ransom_data,ran_system}.  %Our evaluation
%shows  that \system{} can in many cases avoid certain countries while
%performing nearly as well, if not better, than taking default routes.

%Our work presents several opportunities for follow-up studies and
%future work. First, Internet paths continually
%evolve; we will repeat this analysis over time and publish the results
%and data on a public website, to help deepen our collective
%understanding about how the evolution of Internet connectivity affects
%transnational routes. Second, our analysis should be extended to study
%the extent to which citizens in one country can avoid groups of
%countries or even entire regions. Finally, although our results provide strong 
%evidence for the existence of various transnational data flows, factors
%such as uncertain IP geolocation make it difficult to provide clients
%guarantees about country-level avoidance; developing techniques and
%systems that offer clients stronger guarantees
%is a ripe opportunity for future work.
