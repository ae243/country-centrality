\section{Routing Around Nation-States}
\label{system_design}

%The previous section showed a first step at demonstrating the extent of the 
%large-scale surveillance problem, and to our knowledge, there are no existing low-cost, 
%effective countermeasures to this problem.  As we have seen an increase in the number of 
%Internet users electing to use anonymity and circumvention systems, such as Tor, we 
%believe that there are Internet users that would also benefit from a system that 
%counters large-scale surveillance.  

Based on our measurement study, we design the first system to route traffic
around a given country {\it without} the help of either ISPs or content providers.  

%\subsection{Threat Model and Design}


%{\bf Threat Model.} \system{} addresses an adversary who is restricted to a specific region of the world.  The 
%adversary can be passive, and conduct surveillance, or active, and interfere with traffic. We 
%realize that a country's surveillance capabilities are not limited to the infrastructure within 
%its borders, but a country typically can only interfere and manipulate traffic within its borders. 
%For the purposes of this system, we assume the adversary can only view and manipulate traffic 
%within its borders.
%An global adversary that taps routers around the world, splices undersea fiber cables,
%or participates in 
%surveillance in foreign states beyond the scope of our threat model. \system{}
%does not address this
%type of attacker, but \system{} does protect against an attacker whose interference
%and monitoring  capabilities are limited to a specific geography.

\input{design_goals}

{\bf Design Overview.} \system{} comprises (1)~an overlay network of relays; and
(2)~an oracle that
directs clients to the appropriate relays, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:arch}.
\system{}'s relays are TCP proxy servers that allow clients to access web
content without installing custom software. \system{} uses the measurement
methods described in Section~\ref{avoid_results} to learn paths between
clients, relays, and domains; these results are stored at the oracle, which
uses the data to decide which relay a client in some location should use for
accessing a certain domain while avoiding a certain country.  The oracle
periodically computes paths for many combinations of client AS, destination,
and country.   A client can then query the oracle to determine the appropriate
relay to use to avoid a certain country en route to a particular destination.

%Once the TCP proxies are established, a client needs
%to learn which proxy to use when accessing a given domain.

%domains should be accessed through which relays (based on the measured paths).

%The client's traffic is routed through relays (or direct paths) to access domains, 
%while avoiding a client-specified country.}

\subsection{Measuring Paths}

\system{} measures all paths using {\tt 
traceroute}, which is then mapped to the country level using the same methods as 
described in Section~\ref{datasets} and shown in Figure~\ref{fig:analysis_pipeline}.
The paths we measure are the: forward paths from 
the client to each relay; forward paths from each relay to each domain; forward
paths from the client to each domain; and reverse paths from each relay to the 
client. 
%Figure \ref{fig:paths} shows the forward and reverse paths when accessing 
%content using relays; the only path we cannot measure is the reverse path from 
%the domains to the relays because we have no 
%vantage point at or near the domain for running traceroute.
The portion of the reverse path from the domains to the relays is
challenging to measure due to a lack of vantage points in ASes of common
destinations. As discussed in Section \ref{pipeline}, we found that  the
forward and reverse paths are asymmetric at the country level, and therefore
\system{} cannot make any guarantees about which countries are on the path
between  domains and relays even though it has calculated the paths from
relays to domains.   Despite the lack of knowledge about this part of the
reverse path,  we can reason about possible scenarios.  If the client's
traffic is encrypted, then a country on this part of
the reverse path that the client wishes to avoid cannot perform any  traffic correlation
attacks or website
fingerprinting attacks, as the country cannot see who the client is (necessary
for website fingerprinting) and does not have access to more than one part of
the path (necessary for traffic correlation attacks).



{\bf Client-to-Relay Paths.} 
To avoid requiring the client to install custom software, \system{}
measures client-to-relay paths from RIPE Atlas probes that serve as 
vantage points for the ASes where \system{} clients might be.  \system{} selects
probes that
are geographically close the client (\eg, in the same 
country). The oracle triggers the probe to run traceroutes
to each relay.  After collecting the responses, the oracle maps 
the IP-level paths to country-level paths and stores the results.

{\bf Relay-to-Client Paths.} The \system{} relays perform
traceroutes to the IP addresses of RIPE Atlas probes, which 
represent client ASes.  They then derive country-level paths; the
oracle learns these paths from each relay.  

{\bf Relay-to-Server Paths.} Relays perform 
traceroutes to each domain.  As with paths to clients,
relays derive country-level paths and send them to the oracle.

{\bf Client-to-Server Paths.} In case a path from a client to a 
domain does not pass through the country specified to avoid {\it by default}, 
then none of the proxies should be used.  
%If a proxy is used, then it may 
%actually be causing the path to traverse more countries
%(unnecessarily).  
These paths are measured using the RIPE Atlas probes in similar
locations as the clients, and the oracle triggers traceroutes from
each of them to each of the domains.  Corresponding country-level
paths are stored at the oracle.

\system{} must recompute these paths as they change. We measured the country-level paths from a RIPE Atlas probe to the 
Alexa Top 100 domains once per day for a month to see how stable country-level paths 
are.  Across the measured domains, we found the average time between path changes to 
be about five days.  Therefore, \system{} re-computes the paths every five days to incorporate the 
most recent country-level paths.  

%To our knowledge, there has not been any previous work 
%on how often country-level paths change; prior work has explored how often 
%AS-level paths change.  

%To measure how often country-level paths change, we 
%computed the paths from relays to domains once every two hours and once every 
%hour.  Fewer than five paths changed every two hours; the 
%results were similar for one-hour increments.  As it takes approximately 30 minutes to 
%compute all paths, \system{} re-computes the paths every one hour to incorporate 
%the most recent country-level paths.

%path from domain to relay; 4) reverse path from relay to client.  \system{} measures 
%all paths except for path 3) due to a lack of vantage points at domain locations.}

\subsection{Computing and Selecting Paths}
\label{multiplex}

The oracle follows four steps to decide which relay a client should
use to access a specific domain: (1)~If the default path from the
client to the domain does not pass through the specified country, then
do not use any of the relays.  (2)~Otherwise, for all the paths from
the client to the relays, select suitable relays, which are relays where the country 
to avoid is not on the forward or reverse path between the client and 
relay.  (3)~From this set, if there
is a path from a suitable relay to the domain that does not include
the specified country, then use that relay for that domain.  (4)~If
there is no path from the client through any of the relays to the
domain that does not pass through the specified country, then select
the relay that provides the most avoidance (measured by how many other
domains that avoid the specified country).

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\resizebox{.4\textwidth}{!}{
\renewcommand{\lstlistingname}{Configuration}
\lstinputlisting[label={lst:pac}, language=JavaScript, frame=single,
basicstyle=\footnotesize, caption={Example PAC file.}]{example_pac.pac}
\vspace*{-0.25in}
}
\end{figure}

The oracle applies this decision process to each domain, which results
in a mapping of domains to relays that can be used to avoid the given
country.  To automate multiplexing between relays,
\system{} utilizes Proxy Autoconfiguration (PAC) files, which define
how browsers should choose a proxy when fetching a URL.  In the
example PAC file in Configuration~\ref{lst:pac}, proxy 1.2.3.4:3128
should be used when accessing {\tt www.google.com}, but proxy
5.6.7.8:3128 should be used when accessing {\tt www.twitter.com}.  The
oracle uses the mapping of domains to relays to generate a PAC file,
which specifies which domains should be accessed through which proxy.
The PAC file is published online to a URL of the format
$<$client\_country$>$\_$<$country\_to\_avoid$>$\_pac.pac.  The client
uses this URL to specify their proxy configuration.  Paths, and subsequently PAC files, are
re-computed every five days.
% The PAC files are published online, which allows a client to simply
% point the proxy configuration settings to the URL that contains the
% PAC file.

\subsection{Limitations and Extensions}

From our experience conducting measurement studies of Internet paths, we have
identified several limitations and obstacles. We can surmount these obstacles with the cooperation of content providers. To
address the issue of path asymmetry, the reverse path could be measured from
within the provider and used to determine if a country is on the reverse path;
this could be used in conjunction with our measurements  of the forward path.
In addition, content providers could strategically publish DNS records such
that when a client receives a DNS response, it is for a content replica that
allows her to avoid a given country.  A content provider could also  replicate
content in specific regions to allow clients to access replicas without
traversing a specific  country.

%These limittaions include a lack
%of possible measurement methods to
%learn reverse paths and a lack of knowledge about the locations in which
%content is replicated. Additionally, because \system{} does not assume any
%cooperation from content providers, the system does not (and cannot) always
%ensure that some Internet path avoids a particular country.

The current implementation of \system{} does not include support by content
providers, the design itself does not require any changes if providers were
ultimately to cooperate with deployment. Cooperating ISPs and CDNs would
collect and share traceroute data from their locations to different client and
proxy locations and provide those measurements to the \system{} oracle;
\system{} would then convert the traceroute data to country-level paths and
incorporate them into the calculation of the  PAC files.  In certain cases, we
could measure these paths without the cooperation of content providers. For
example, for content hosted in public clouds, we could set up a virtual
machine in those same data centers and have  \system{} collect the reverse
path traceroute data to use when creating the PAC files.

Additional cooperation from content providers could provide further benefits.
For example, CDNs could publish domain names that embed information about
which country to avoid, strategically publish DNS records such  that clients
can take advantage of open DNS resolvers, and replicate content in diverse
geographic locations.
