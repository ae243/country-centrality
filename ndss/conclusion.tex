\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

We have characterized routing
detours that take Internet paths through foreign countries, which may 
make clients susceptible to foreign surveillance, performance 
degradation, and increased costs.  We find that paths commonly traverse known
surveillance states, even when they originate and end in a
non-surveillance state.  As a first step towards a remedy, we have
investigated how clients, ISPs, and governments can use overlay network relays to prevent routing detours through
unfavorable jurisdictions.  This method gives clients the power to
avoid certain countries, as well as help keep local traffic local.
%Although some countries are completely avoidable, we find that some of
%the more prominent surveillance states are the least avoidable.
We have
designed, implemented, and deployed \system{}, which employs overlay network
relays to  route traffic around a given country; our data and code is publicly available~\cite{ransom_data,ran_system}.  Our evaluation
shows  that \system{} can in many cases avoid certain countries while
performing nearly as well, if not better, than taking default routes.

%Our work presents several opportunities for follow-up studies and
%future work. First, Internet paths continually
%evolve; we will repeat this analysis over time and publish the results
%and data on a public website, to help deepen our collective
%understanding about how the evolution of Internet connectivity affects
%transnational routes. Second, our analysis should be extended to study
%the extent to which citizens in one country can avoid groups of
%countries or even entire regions. Finally, although our results provide strong 
%evidence for the existence of various transnational data flows, factors
%such as uncertain IP geolocation make it difficult to provide clients
%guarantees about country-level avoidance; developing techniques and
%systems that offer clients stronger guarantees
%is a ripe opportunity for future work.
