\paragraph{Nation-state routing analysis}  Shah and
Papadopoulos recently measured international routing detours---paths that originate
in
one country, cross international borders, and then return to the
original country---using public Border Gateway Protocol~(BGP) routing tables~\cite
{shah2015characterizing}. 
The study discovered 2 million detours each month out
of 7 billion paths.

as opposed to analyzing BGP
routes.  Obar and Clement analyzed traceroutes
that started and ended in Canada, but tromboned through the United
States, and argued that
this is a violation of Canadian network
sovereignty~\cite{obar2012internet}. 
Karlin \ea{} developed a framework for country-level
routing analysis to study how much influence each country has over
interdomain routing~\cite{karlin2009nation}.  This work measures country
centrality using BGP routes and AS-path inference; in contrast, our work uses active 
measurements and measures avoidability of a given country. 

\paragraph{Mapping national Internet topologies}  Roberts \ea{} developed a method
for mapping national networks and identifying ASes that act as points of
control~\cite{roberts2011mapping}.   %JEN: not clear we care about the
 Several studies have also characterized network paths {\em
within} a country, including
Germany~\cite{wahlisch2010framework,wahlisch2012exposing} and
China~\cite{zhou2007chinese}, or a country's interconnectivity %within a region
%or with the rest of theworld~
\cite{bischof2015and,gupta2014peering,fanou2015diversity}; these studies
focus on intra-country paths, as opposed to focusing on
transnational paths.

\paragraph{Routing overlays and Internet architectures} Alibi Routing uses
round-trip times to prove that that a client's packets did  not traverse a
forbidden country or region~\cite{levin2015alibi,levin_detour}; our work differs by
measuring  which countries a client's packets would (and do) traverse.  Our
work then  uses active measurements to determine the best path for a client
wishing  to connect to a server.  RON, Resilient Overlay Network, is an
overlay network that  routes around failures~\cite{andersen2001resilient}, whereas our overlay network
routes around countries.  ARROW introduces a
model that allows users to route around ISPs~\cite{peter2015one}, but requires
ISP participation, making it considerably more difficult to deploy than
\system{}. ARROW also aims to improve fault-tolerance, robustness, and
security, rather than explicitly attempting to avoid certain countries; ARROW
provides mechanisms to avoid individual ISPs, but such a mechanism is at a
different level of granularity, because an ISP may span multiple countries.
Zhang \ea{} presented SCION, a ``clean-slate'' Internet architecture that
provides route control, failure isolation, and explicit trust information for
communication~\cite{zhang2011scion}; SCION, however, requires fundamental
changes to the Internet architecture, whereas \system{} is deployable today.

\paragraph{Circumvention systems}  Certain tools, such as anonymous
communications systems or virtual private networks~\cite{dingledine2004tor,nobori2014vpn,piotrowska2017loopix,van2015vuvuzela,wolinsky2012dissen,tyagi2016stadium,corrigan2015riposte,kwon2016atom,kwon2016riffle,gelernter2016two}, may use a combination of
encryption and overlay routing to allow clients to avoid surveillance. Tor is
an anonymity system that uses three relays and layered encryption to allow
users to communicate anonymously~\cite{dingledine2004tor}.  In contrast,
\system{} does not aim to achieve anonymity; instead, its aim is to ensure
that traffic does not traverse a specific  country, a goal that Tor cannot
achieve.  Even tools like Tor do not inherently thwart surveillance: Tor is
vulnerable to traffic correlation attacks and some attacks are possible even
on encrypted user traffic. VPNGate is a public VPN relay system aimed at
circumventing national firewalls~\cite{nobori2014vpn}. Unfortunately, VPNGate
does not allow a client to choose any available VPN, which makes it more
difficult for a user to ensure that traffic avoids a particular part of the
Internet.  Neither of these systems explicitly avoid countries; thus, they may
not  be able to avoid surveillance or the laws or jurisdiction of a particular
country. Additionally, existing circumvention systems generally rely on
encryption, which does not prevent surveillance; prior research has shown that
websites can be fingerprinted based on size, content, and location of third
party resources, which  reveals information about the content a user is
accessing \cite{what_isps_can_see}.  Finally, ISPs often execute man-in-the-middle attacks on TLS connections to perform network-management
functions~\cite{mitm_isp}.
