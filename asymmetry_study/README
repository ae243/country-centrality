This folder contains all code and data for measuring path asymmetry at the country level.

asymmetry_latest_mm.txt:
    Contains the mapping of IP Address to country code (and long/lat)

asymmetry_results_log.txt:
    Contains pairs of forward and reverse paths, as well as the resulting values for symmetric/asymmetric paths

get_asymmetry_data.py:
    Pulls measurements from RIPE Atlas (from other researchers' previous study of asymmetry - at the IP level) and produces the country level paths (written to asymmetry_results_log.txt)

get_ips.py:
    Pulls all IP address from RIPE Atlas measurements in measurementids.txt

get_subset_data.py:
    Gets the number of paths where the reverse path has a subset of countries of the forward path

ips.txt:
    List of all IP addresses in the measurementids.txt file

measurementids.txt:
    List of all RIPE Atlas measurement ids for the asymmetry study

util.py:
    Utility methods
